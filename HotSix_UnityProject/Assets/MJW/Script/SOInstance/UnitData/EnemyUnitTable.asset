      e_information: Because of the carapace that always loses water, the mercenary
        Tuca, who has a lot of manna, made them find an empty cannon one day. As
        you can see, it doesn't fit right? Oh, don't ask me how to get it. It has
        a habit of hiding because it is afraid of attack. Instead, block your team
        from enemy attacks with high health and defense.
